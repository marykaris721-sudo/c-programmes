DESCRIPTION:3D Array â€“ Multiple Branches
The hotel chain has 3 branches, each with 5 floors and 10 rooms per floor.
1. Use a 3D array chain[3][5][10] to represent all branches.
2. Assign random occupancy (1 or 0) to each room.
3. Calculate and display the total number of occupied rooms across all branches
